## 1. Education and Training: Classroom Option

### Background on the Course:

The company provides half day training sessions for supervisors to ensure they understand their company policy/expectations and their responsibilities in its implementation. This training covers the following:

- background on alcohol and drugs and legal obligations and responsibilities of the company and its representatives
- specifics on the company policy (as required)
- information on alcohol and drug testing (if it is a component of the policy)
- supervisor responsibilities (performance management, dealing with unfit for duty situations, and if required, making testing referrals in a post incident and reasonable cause situation)

It also includes practical case studies and a video on appropriate performance management procedures. A manual of materials is provided to support the program, including cases, procedures, and documentation forms to support the supervisor in meeting their responsibilities.

### Options:

The program can also be delivered to supervisors in companies subject to the U.S. Department of Transportation Regulations for cross-border motor carrier drivers and fully meets the regulatory requirements. An additional module on the U.S. regulations is delivered, and procedures and cases are specific to the regulatory requirements.

Parts of the program can also be delivered to employees. In these situations, companies have opted to have supervisors and employees in combined sessions on the first three modules (background on alcohol and drugs, specifics on the company policy and testing overview) and then extend the session for managers and supervisors to cover their responsibilities, the cases and the video.

In certain situations, a “train the trainer” option is also available.

## 2. Education and Training Course: Internet Option

### Background on the Course:

Many companies are recognizing that training supervisors through an on-line approach is more practical and effective for their particular workplace, particularly when employees are located at a number of sites and/or they would like their supervisors to have ongoing access to the resources and scenarios through a dedicated site. This education and training program has been set up in a way that can meet two purposes:

- Train supervisors to understand the issues and meet their responsibilities under company policy; and if an employer chooses
- Educate employees on the issues of concern to them and their company policy.

It can be used as a “stand-alone” training option or be a resource to supplement live sessions on an ongoing basis, with periodic reviews through the refresher module. It contains three sections:

1. The core course is broken into four modules:
   - background on alcohol and drugs (suitable for supervisors and employees)
   - company policy (suitable for supervisors and employees)
   - information on alcohol and drug testing (suitable for supervisors and employees)
   - supervisor responsibilities (specific focus on supervisors)
2. Refresher training for supervisors.
3. Situation handling for supervisors.

This is supported through a library of resources found through the course modules, the refresher and the situation handling, so that a supervisor can look up information or download procedures and documentation forms at any time. They can also create their own library of key resources.

There are quizzes throughout the course to check learning, as well as an exam at the end of the course that tests the supervisor‘s overall knowledge of the key learning points. They receive a certificate of completion which is on record at the company to confirm due diligence in training the individuals who play a key role in their policy implementation. The program is available in French and English.

### Objective/Advantages:

The objective is not only to provide an opportunity for initial education and training for all employees, but in the case of the supervisors, to provide a resource through the situation handling, library components and refresher which will help them meet their ongoing responsibilities, and responding to unexpected circumstances.

By using an Internet model, it recognizes that it is difficult for people to absorb a lot of new information in a short (e.g. 3-4 hour) course with a trainer. It also recognizes that these are often “one time” events, and that individuals may find they need an opportunity to review the information periodically to ensure they are confident about their responsibilities and the company‘s expectations.

Instead, this learning method:

- allows someone to go through the course at their own pace,
- lets them focus specifically on areas of interest or greater complexity,
- reinforces the learning experience with a series of quizzes,
- allows the core information normally delivered in a “live” course to be supplemented with a variety of resources, some of general interest (especially for employees) and some specific to support the supervisor‘s work,
- permits the user to access resources as they proceed through the course, or any time thereafter, knowing these resources are updated on an ongoing basis,
- allows a company to reinforce their due diligence by requiring periodic refresher training to make sure supervisors understand the concepts and their responsibilities, and
- provides a series of easily accessible scenarios representing situations they may face on a day-to-day basis, supported by with the resources and tools they need to deal with an immediate problem.

Using the Internet also has the advantage of ensuring all individuals, including newly appointed supervisors, have the same learning opportunity supported by consistent information. Companies do not have to wait until there are a sufficient number of people needing training to justify bringing in a trainer, and in addition, can ensure individuals in remote locations have the same access to information as others in the company.

Finally, this system allows the company to track individuals through their username/password to ensure they have completed the course or to ensure they have completed any required refresher training. It also provides a fast and efficient way for the company administrator to update users on new features or any changes in company policy or procedures. (see below)

### Options:

Many companies may choose to use the Internet training course only for supervisor training, and all of the information they need is provided. Some may also want to use this vehicle to educate employees. In that case, the employee password would provide access to the first three modules so that employees can be educated on alcohol and drug issues, on their company policy and any specific assistance opportunities provided by the company, and on how alcohol and drug testing works. They would have access to this information on an ongoing basis.

One additional feature is a “what‘s new” section which allows the content experts to input additional resources of interest, and allows the company administrator to update information specific to their policy or implementation requirements as needed. Any policy changes, or any direction to supervisors on procedural changes can be immediately identified through this “what‘s new” component.

A further version of the course can be available to organizations that do not use testing in their program. There is also a dedicated program to meet U.S. Department of Transportation requirements.

### Set up:

A core program is already online which can be used in the generic version to meet most workplace requirements. Another option is to make the content company-specific; the following types of things would need to be done:

- input the company policy in the same format as the rest of the course, including any supporting/resource documents as appropriate (Module 2);
- confirm supervisor procedures in unfit for duty and testing circumstances are consistent with the company policy and that documentation forms meet company requirements;
- add quizzes specific to the company policy in the refresher section of the course;
- add scenarios specific to the company requirements in the scenario section of the course;
- modify the exam to meet company-specific needs.

In addition, steps must be taken on the technology side to “brand” the course specific to the company, including how it is presented on the page, access usernames/passwords, and the addition of other specific components or “upgrades” requested by the company to support their program.

A branded version also allows the program administrator at the company to make modifications and update material as needed.
